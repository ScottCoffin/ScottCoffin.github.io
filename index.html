My name's Scott Coffin, welcome to my website. I have a PhD in Environmental Toxicology and study the interactions between plastic and the environment (humans included). I am currently serving as a Research Scientist III at the California State Water Resources Control Board, where I develop regulations for drinking water for all Californians.
