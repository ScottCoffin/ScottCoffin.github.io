My name's Michael Culshaw-Maurer, welcome to my website. I'm a 3rd-year PhD candidate in the Graduate Group in Ecology at UC Davis, where I'm co-advised by Jay Rosenheim and Sebastian Schreiber. You can read more about my research, view some of my photography galleries, or check out my blog for scattered thoughts on R, ecology, and the NBA.
