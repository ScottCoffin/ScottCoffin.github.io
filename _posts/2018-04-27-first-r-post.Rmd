# Let's figure this out

## well this is neat

Let's try a plot

```{r opts, echo = FALSE}
title <- "first-r-post"
knitr::opts_knit$set(base.dir = "/Users/MJ/Github/mcmaurer.github.io/", base.url = "/")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = paste0("assets/rmd-images/", title, "/"))
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg))+
  geom_point()
```
