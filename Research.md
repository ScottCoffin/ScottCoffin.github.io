## Ecotoxicology: Plastic as a vector for contaminants
My primary area of study for my PhD was in determining the ability for [plastic to transfer contaminants to biota](https://pqdtopen.proquest.com/pubnum/10982838.html?FMT=AI) using bioanalytical screening tools, analytical chemistry, biomimetic models, Japanese medaka and White seabass fish, and computer simulations.


## Bioanalytical screening tools

During graduate school, I collaborated on a number of projects using bioanalytical tools.

## Microplastics in Drinking Water

Since graduate school, I have shifted my focus to human health, and am the lead scientist in California's implementation of [SB 1422- Microplastics in drinking water](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/microplastics.html).
