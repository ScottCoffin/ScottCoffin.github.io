My name is Michael Culshaw-Maurer. I'm a 5th-year PhD candidate and [USDA NIFA Predoctoral Fellow](https://nifa.usda.gov/funding-opportunity/agriculture-and-food-research-initiative-education-workforce-development) in the Graduate Group in Ecology at UC Davis, where I'm co-advised by [Jay Rosenheim](https://rosenheim.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) and [Sebastian Schreiber](http://www.eve.ucdavis.edu/sschreiber/). I am broadly interested in trait-mediated effects in biological control systems, but you can read more about that on my [research page](https://mcmaurer.github.io/Research/). I am an Affiliate of the UC Davis [Data Science Initiative](http://datascience.ucdavis.edu/), co-coordinator of the [Davis R Users Group](https://d-rug.github.io/), co-founder of the UC Davis Nuanced Understanding of Ecological Modeling group, and I teach the graduate level [R for Data Analysis and Visualization in Science](https://gge-ucd.github.io/R-DAVIS/index.html) course. I have also served as a Head Steward for the [UC Student Workers Union](http://www.uaw2865.org/) and helped run beer tastings with the UCD Food Science Brewing Club.

I'm a hobbyist photographer, which serves as a nice creative outlet after a long day in the lab or office. You can check out some of my galleries on my [photography page](https://mcmaurer.github.io/Photography/). I also enjoy playing racquetball and lacrosse, camping, canoeing, hiking, and thrift shopping.

If you're on the UCD campus, you can find me in Briggs 320 (Rosenheim Lab) or Storer 5350 (Schreiber Lab). You can also email me at mjculshawmaurer [at] ucdavis [dot] edu. You can follow me on Twitter or Github by following the links at the bottom of this page. You can also try carrier pigeon, message in a bottle, or yelling really loud, but these have proven less successful.
