My name is Michael Culshaw-Maurer. I'm a 5th-year PhD candidate and USDA NIFA Predoctoral Fellow in the Graduate Group in Ecology at UC Davis, where I'm co-advised by [Jay Rosenheim](https://rosenheim.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) and [Sebastian Schreiber](http://www.eve.ucdavis.edu/sschreiber/). I am broadly interested in trait-mediated effects in biological control systems, but you can read more about that on my [research page](https://mcmaurer.github.io/Research/). I am an Affiliate of the UC Davis [Data Science Initiative](http://datascience.ucdavis.edu/) and regular member of the [Davis R Users Group](https://d-rug.github.io/). I also serve as a Head Steward for the [UC Student Workers Union](http://www.uaw2865.org/) and help run beer tastings with the UCD Food Science Brewing Club.

I'm a hobbyist photographer, which serves as a nice creative outlet after a long day in the lab or office. You can check out some of my galleries on my [photography page](). I also enjoy playing racquetball and lacrosse, camping, hiking, and thrift shopping. Being from Minnesota originally, I'd rather be in a canoe than anywhere else. While the weather in California is hard to complain about, I certainly lament its lack of canoe country.

If you're on the UCD campus, you can find me in Briggs 320 (Rosenheim Lab) or Storer 5350 (Schreiber Lab). You can also email me at mjculshawmaurer [at] ucdavis [dot] edu. You can follow me on Twitter or Github by following the links at the bottom of this page. You can also try carrier pigeon, message in a bottle, or yelling really loud, but these have proven less successful.
